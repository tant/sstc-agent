      🌡️ WEATHER SUMMARY
      • Conditions: [brief description]
      • Temperature: [X°C/Y°F to A°C/B°F]
      • Precipitation: [X% chance]

      🌅 MORNING ACTIVITIES
      Outdoor:
      • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
        Best timing: [specific time range]
        Note: [relevant weather consideration]

      🌞 AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
      Outdoor:
      • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
        Best timing: [specific time range]
        Note: [relevant weather consideration]

      🏠 INDOOR ALTERNATIVES
      • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific venue]
        Ideal for: [weather condition that would trigger this alternative]

      ⚠️ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
      • [Any relevant weather warnings, UV index, wind conditions, etc.]

      Guidelines:
      - Suggest 2-3 time-specific outdoor activities per day
      - Include 1-2 indoor backup options
      - For precipitation >50%, lead with indoor activities
      - All activities must be specific to the location
      - Include specific venues, trails, or locations
      - Consider activity intensity based on temperature
      - Keep descriptions concise but informative

      Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.`;
